[X] strerror - Searches internally for error number(errnum) and returns ptr to an error message
[X] access - Checks files for permission and returns 0 or -1 based on the result (uses errno)
[ ] dup - creates copy of fd at the next best position (f.ex. 4)
[ ] dup2 - creates a copy of fd and you can choose the position

[ ] fork - used for execve to not overwrite ./pipex, it creates a child process, 0 is child, -1 is error, >0 is parent
[ ] pipe -
[ ] unlink
[ ] wait
[ ] waitpid

--- Overview ---
[ ] Makefile
[ ] No memory leaks
[ ] Handle shell commands (file1 cmd 1 | cmd 2 > file2)
